# Heat kernel method for Wilson loops

My code for the publication http://arxiv.org/abs/1702.02164.
The objective is to calculate a product/ratio of determinants of matrix-valued Laplace and Dirac operators with the heat kernel method in Section 2.
This is done on 3 different deformations of the hyperbolic plane $H^2$ embedded in $AdS_5\times S^5$.

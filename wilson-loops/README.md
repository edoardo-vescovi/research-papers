# Wilson loops in (supersymmetric) gauge theories

Special-topic lectures @ Imperial College London, July 2019 and 2020

Wilson loops are operators defined along closed paths in spacetime. Originally designed to explain quark confinement in QCD, they have become important observables to measure non-local properties of the gauge field. In these lectures we introduce Wilson loops from the notion of parallel transport in gauge theory and go through the textbook calculation of the potential energy of a pair of pointlike charges in Maxwell's theory. We then focus on a model endowed with supersymmetry and build the generalisation of the operator that is invariant under such symmetry. The Wilson loop over the circle is a quite rare example of observable that can be computed exactly by resumming the diagrammatical expansion.

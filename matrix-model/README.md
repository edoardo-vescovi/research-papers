# Loop equations for generalised eigenvalue models

My code for the publication http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13835.
The objective is to solve the integro-differential equation for the 1-point Wilson operator $\mathbb{W}(x)$ (the inverse Laplace transform of the 1-point resolvent) of generalised eigenvalue models (generalisations of matrix models with general measure and potential functions). The models contain two parameters: the number of "eigenvalue" variables $N$ and the scale of the coupling constant $\lambda$. In the paper we solve in perturbation theory for large $N$ and either small or large $\lambda$. The notebooks automatise the former expansion.

# Gel'fand-Yaglom method for Wilson loops

My code for the publication https://arxiv.org/abs/1512.00841.
The objective is to calculate a product/ratio $Z$ of determinants of matrix-valued Laplace and Dirac operators on 2d surface embedded in $AdS_5\times S^5$ with the Gel'fand-Yaglom method in Appendix B.
